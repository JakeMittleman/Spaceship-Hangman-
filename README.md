# Spaceship-Hangman-
A playable game of Hangman with a sweet space theme!

<h2> How to Run </h2>
Open and run the Driver.py file. You type letters into the terminal to guess. With each incorrect guess, part of the ship is drawn. When the game is over you can play again!

<h3> How to play </h3>
This is a game of Hangman. You type letters one by one in the terminal to guess the blank word in the bottom right of the screen. If the letter exists in the current word being guessed, it'll appear and you continue to guess. If not, part of the ship will be drawn. When all of the ship is drawn (or 5 incorrect guesses) you lose.

<h3> Editing the word list </h3>
More or less words are possible by editing the wordlist.txt file. Try adding your own words!
